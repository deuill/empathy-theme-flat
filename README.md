# Flat theme for Empathy (and possibly Adium).

This repository contains a flat theme, made and tested for Empathy, but possibly working on Adium as well.

To install locally for Empathy, simply place the `Flat.AdiumMessageStyle` directory in `~/.local/share/adium` and change the active theme in Empathy's preferences dialog.

## Screenshots

There are two styles currently available, "Blue on Grey" and "Blue on Grey Alternating".
